--> This is a game I created that is similar to Bug Squish. Instead of squishing bugs, the player will pop balloons. Once the game starts, the player will have 30 seconds to pop as many balloons they can. I was going to have two LED lights on the arduino board connected to this game but somehow the arduino board decided it doesn't want to work. One green LED light was going to blink in tempo with the music while the player plays the game while the other red LED light was going to flash when the game. I had the built in LED flashing for this during my presentation but now it doesn't want to work :( A video of this project is uploaded on my YouTube.
